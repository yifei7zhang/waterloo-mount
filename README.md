# waterloo filemount system

Run the init script first to make these scripts work for you. This assumes that you already have an ssh key generated, that exists at ~/.ssh/.id_rsa

Run the following commands:
 ```
chmod u+x init.sh
./init.sh
```

These will make startup scripts work with your username, and generate a waterloo folder that has a mount of your student environment.
